# Python
- Python was my very first programming language. After attending Nashville Software School my focus had been shifted so the goal of this repo is to brush up on python and now that I know how I learn best I intend on diving even deeper this time around!

## Goals

 - Set up Visual Studio Code for python development [x]
 - Play around with python without looking at any documentation [x]
 - Write a for loop, create variables, take in user input from the console [x]
 - Discover similarities and differences between C# and Python specifically.
